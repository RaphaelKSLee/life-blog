Happy 25th year of impending death to me! ðŸ¥³ 
Friends and foes alike, let us celebrate my *mid*-mid-life crisis.

Anyway, I suppose for any unfortunate soul curious enough to read this, this lengthy piece of absolutely 0 worth for you would probably contain some quick updates on my life, a fair bit of schizophrenic rambling, and some new-(relative)-year's resolution (that I probably will fail in following through). Honestly, I'm just writing to collect my thoughts, as I said, rambling, so good luck fabricating value from a bunch of nonsense.

# Updates
## Not dead yet
I'm alive! Still! Somehow! Considering kicking, not the bucket, not yet, at least. Impressive at it's own right, I suppose. Afterall, I've been voted the most likely to die young and die first in my highschool graduating class. Frail old me still holding strong, miraculously.

A good few years ago, a friend joked about not knowing if I'm dead or alive, as I neither use social media nor contact anyone. Just isn't really my thing, I guess. Never felt too compelled. Everyone's still on my mind, make no mistake. It's just that I don't really actively seek people out without good reason. To make up for it, this is my belated update for anyone who mildly remembers me. See you in another 25 years!

## Livelihood and no-life-ing
So, I'm finally graduating from my bachelors, probably next month. Quite the journey, I must say. Highschool science to associate's arts and back to bachelor's science. Some might consider it a good 3 years wasted. Perhaps, but I would have went with other career paths otherwise. (Oh I so fondly recall my days where I romanticized being a burger-flipping philosophy major, NOT!) 

I ended up with Software Engineering, aka writing programs and a bit more. Not very happy with the "HK no IT" scene but I'll try find some corner in the industry with some like-minded colleagues that cares.

I also ended up moving out and living semi-alone-ish. The bills, the chores, the responsibilities, quite depressing, I must say. My SWE job of almost 2 years is supporting my finances just enough that I don't go to debt. I *might* have had some impulse tech purchases here and there, but it's bears absolutely no relevance to this topic. Haha. Please. \**thousand yard stares*\* (If anyone of you are looking to get something 3D printed, mechanical keyboard soldered, or a website hosted, feel free to ask, I might have some stuff sitting around. LOL)

But for real, full-time work, in office 100% of the time, but working solo, has me drained for the most part, eating away even my weekends. Most of the time are spent sleeping, being awake for a couple of hours, then falling back asleep. Hopefully it's not depression or something else serious, fingers-crossed. 

# Woe is me
I don't feel I have matured, like at all. Unless you count working a soulless corporate job 9-6 and numbing the mind by playing video games afterwards. Another likely out is that grinding my bones to dust for career advancements even during off-time counts as "maturity", now isn't *that* encouraging. I'm not sure if I can handle the grim reality of being "mature". \**hurls*\*

At the same time, I can't say I'm too satisfied with my option of pastime. Granted, it's not short-form video content for the attention-deficient. But esports? Really? Not be the lowest of lows, but not far away from it as well. The adorable little 9 year old bookworm that I once was would surely spit on current me's face, *I'd* spit on my face.

A bit reductive of myself, as I still read a lot, in very career-related forums now instead of good ol' books. But what is theoretical knowledge without action? Pretty much intellectual masturbation if you ask me. 

For the ego and p\*tential I possess, neither matching outcome nor redeeming effort is shown. (Oooh the P-word nauseates me to no end.) The fear and shame for achieving so little despite having so much suffocate me, every waking alarm, every clock tick, every heartbeat, yet I'm still too lethargic to do more.

# Bit of a kick, bit of a cope
## On the body
Attempting to manifest action by sending fear and shame into overdrive doesn't sound too healthy, I'll be honest.  
And to be fair to myself, I *did* just juggle between my full-time job and my full-time education's final year project and have not had a meaningful timeout period, so there might be some mild burnout, but I'm not at a position to afford a sabbatical. Gosh darn adulting.

Perhaps ridding me of my frail body will also rid me of my frail mind. As an attempt, I have finally hit the gym two weeks ago, for the first time in my life.   
THE GYM HIT BACK, LIKE A FUCKING TRUCK. OW.  
My chest and triceps still hurt when I stretch today. It's insane. Hopefully it gets better going forward. FUCK.

Anyway, I guess I'll try keep at it. I don't know in what currency I'll pay in for this effort, might as well be taking a huge loan with sanity as collateral. Hope the dividends help pay back the interest at least. I do still have some lingering adoration of my androgynous build though. Oh well, what must be done must be done, I suppose. Wouldn't wanna be caught skinny-fat in my mid-30s. \**Bleurgh*\*

## On the psyche
I've considered maybe getting a significant other and working towards a future together might work well as a motivating factor. Not too sure about this though, as you might have noticed, I'm more of the aloof type, and social needs are more of an alien concept to me. Instead of fulfillment and gratification, this just spells more responsibility and burden for my current self. Not to mention the "ulterior motive" aspect of things. Sugar mommies are welcome though. Just kidding, haha, unless?

Who knows how it'll turn out in actuality, but it's just so much effort for an uncertain amount of payout.

You know what?  Not even having 0 social needs, scratch that, make it negative. Between the COVID isolation, 2-hour roundtrip commute to work, 0 teammates, and unhelpful up/down-stream colleagues, my social needs have been reduced to atoms, annihilated, obliterated. I have not correlated real life interaction to anything but transactional pleasantries for a good while now. 

Maybe a better workplace would help rebuild my social dopamine receptors. I don't know, I'll start looking though. Ideally an English speaking one, but any improvement is hardly refusable.

On the topic of jobs, my insurance agent tried to coax me into joining their team. The financial prospect is kind of interesting, but with migrating to the US as my long-term goal, I don't see how the transition from an SWE to a trade that's more or less limited to the local financial market. Not to mention the less than spectacular reputation of agents. I've also looked into teaching IT and English in secondary schools for a bit, but again, what good is it for migrating to the US?

Sidenote: The agent's regional director did put up a speech on taking control over your own life and being your own boss, instead of endless humble servitude. The bullshit and gaslighting aside, his words does have some truth to it. Influencing my decision to look for greener pastures and self improvement.
# Outro
Hopefully, you aren't waiting for a meaningful conclusion. I was simply rambling about, as aforementioned. But if you insist, I was struggling, I am struggling, and I will be struggling, that's all.

Peace.
