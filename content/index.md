title: THE cringe content compendium

dWelcome to my humble... some call it a hypertext digital garden, I uh, call it my shitter. Bloody pompous academics, amirite?

Ideally, I would have built something more fully functioned, but as usual, procrastination got to my ass. So here you go, something quick and dirty, rushed out for a certain anniversary.

There might be some upcoming technical posts, depends on if I feel like it, but it won't live long on this site, as I intend on separately hosting the content in the long term, providing at least a mirage of separation between my unhinged and professional self. 

Go read my [[Life/]] updates, my [[Tech/]] stuff, or a book.
